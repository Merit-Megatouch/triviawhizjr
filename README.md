# TRIVIA WHIZ JR (triviawhizjr)

One game of [megatouch-port](https://github.com/Merit-Megatouch/megatouch-port):
original Megatouch ION cabinet games running on Linux / WSL2.

This repo holds the port's configuration and notes — no cabinet code or assets. Use it from
the main repo, where it lives at `games/triviawhizjr`:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Merit-Megatouch/megatouch-port
cd megatouch-port && make setup && make new GAME=triviawhizjr && make run GAME=triviawhizjr
```
